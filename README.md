Railway Management System

First Meeting Agenda For Now:

Talking to get the overall structure of the Database so that progress on the website can get started.


Ideas for Now:

Using python -> Flask to create the website.
	This will still utilize HTML but will serve as the backend of the website.

Intending to use SQLAlchemy to linked the SQL Server to the website
	Other potential options are MYSQL.
	Open to suggestions for potential libraries to link the server.

OVERALL SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE APPRECIATED ON BETTER DESIGNS OR TECHNOLOGIES
